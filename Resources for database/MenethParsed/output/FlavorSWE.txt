In 1434 the peasants of Dalarna (The Dales) in Sweden had had enough of union king Erik's crushing taxes and brutal sheriffs. Led by Engelbrekt, the peasants and miners, supported by certain factions within the Church and gentry, rose up in open rebellion. They captured castle after castle and soon controlled the greater part of Sweden. Meanwhile, Erik Puke had joined Engelbrekt in revolt in Finland. For two years, Engelbrekt was the de-facto ruler of Sweden, but intrigue among the noblemen and infighting between Engelbrekt, Erik Puke and Karl Knutsson finally resulted in Engelbrekts murder at the hands of Måns Bengtsson Natt och Dag.

An assiduous politician, Christina was able to keep the bitter class rivalries that broke out after the war from lapsing into civil war but was unable to solve the desperate financial problems caused by the long years of fighting. In the end, she had to recall Oxenstierna and accept the failure of her reform program.

In Gustav Vasa's time there was little difference between a rich farmer and a nobleman, but the situation changed towards the end of his life. Erik XIV kept the nobles on a short leash whereas his brother John wanted to expand their privileges. The third brother, who was to become Charles IX, hated the nobility with an almost revolutionary fervor and surrounded himself with men of the lower classes, toying with ideas that were unheard of in his time. Under Gustavus Adolphus and Axel Oxenstierna the pendulum swung the other way and the nobles gained both land and power. This tendency took an abrupt end with Charles XI, who after the humiliating defeat of Sweden in 1679 commenced a policy of wide scale reductions of the lands and powers of the nobility and abolished the special privileges of the Baltic lords.

Apart from his centralization efforts and huge reduction of aristocratic land holdings, he also remodeled the army. Most importantly, he devised the genial 'indelningsverk', or military-tenure system. The system was a military organization where the soldiers were given a croft to live on and cultivate (made possible by the reduction), where the harvest served as their wages. Thus the country could maintain a large army in both times of peace and of war. If a peasant assumed the responsibility of maintaining an enlisted rider, his horse and equipment, he was exempted from conscription and freed from paying taxes. The peasants could cooperate in groups of 2-5 farms and maintain a soldier or a sailor. The soldiers were organized into companies of 150 men, and every county should field a regiment of 1200 men. The new system also made no distinction between officers of noble birth and commoners.

It was with their return that the movement really took off in Sweden. However, the Swedish Lutheran Church disapproved most strongly of unauthorized preaching, which led to the Conventicle Edict of 1726, forbidding any religious gatherings outside the framework of the Church.

At the time, Sweden had a magnificent fleet and a rather effective army, but most of the officers could be described as politicians rather than soldiers. The Swedish army began marching on St. Petersburg and won some minor battles despite the compact resistance from the officers. On August 12 a group of 112 Finnish noble officers formed the 'Anjala League' and opened up negotiations with the Russians, declaring the war to be illegal and probing for the possibility of an independent Finnish state. This event effectively ended all hopes of a Swedish victory since the king was in a poor position to execute the traitors and have them replaced.

The fire broke out in what is today the sixth arrondissement, and while containing Palais Royal, the Hôtel de Ville, and the Notre Dame Cathedral would be out of danger, separated from the fire by the Seine River, it soon became clear that everything south of the river was in grave jeopardy. The confusion between the Swedish-speaking administrators and their French-speaking firefighter subordinates left the response effort disjointed and chaotic, though a heroic effort tried to save it, the still-new Pont Royal burned, barring any further ability to save southern Paris. Making the matters worse, screaming, wailing refugees formed chaotic mobs. A rioting mob of the new homeless stormed what is now the 8th arrondissement, pillaging the Champs-Élysees. Only Swedish soldiers prevented the critical fourth arrondissement and the Palais Royal from receiving the same fate. Once the ashes settled, much of French Paris had vanished. King Johan saw an opportunity in the ruined remnants of his new city. He set up an official, subsidized settlement for refugees, but placed it in Saint-Germain. As the French homeless moved out of Paris for less central parts of Ile-de-France, Johan hired Maurice de Blois, the greatest architect of the day, to rebuild the areas south of the Seine in a very Scandinavian style. Johan, nervous that the nobles back in Sweden would revolt, came up with a creative solution. He invited the nobility of Sweden and Finland to resettle in southern Paris, so they would have proximity to the Palais Royal, and so Johan could keep an eye on them.

At the Riksdag of 1738 the Hats managed to outmaneuver the peaceful Arvid Horn and seize power. Horn had made the mistake of renewing the defensive alliance of 1724 with Russia and at the same time trying to negotiate a subsidy treaty with France, which was still officially supporting Stanislaw Leszczynski against the Russians in Poland.

Nevertheless, the king and his queen, Lovisa Ulrika, tried to sabotage the council sessions and enforce their will whenever they got the chance. In 1756, the Council informed the king that they were going to start using a royal seal on documents he refused to sign. Furious at this blatant insult, the Queen began planning a Coup d'Etat in June, but her co-conspirators were exposed and executed. As a result, royal power was reduced yet another notch.
