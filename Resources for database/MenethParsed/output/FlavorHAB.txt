Into this atmosphere of enhanced tension broke a climatic event of unusual severity. In 1626, during the last week of May, in the middle of the vegetation period, winter returned. The temperature fell so that lakes and rivers froze and trees shed their leaves. The unexpected return of winter caused panic and anxiety among the peasants who could not remember ever experiencing such destruction of their fields. This event, combined with the brutal persecution of Protestants, led the mainly Protestant peasants of Upper Austria, pledged to Bavaria, to revolt. The peasants were defeated after heavy fighting, and in 1628 the country passed into the hands of the emperor again.

Maria Theresa realized, however, that no military reform would be effective without financial reform and in this area, advised by the brilliant Friedrich Wilhelm, Count von Haugwitz, she achieved her perhaps greatest accomplishments. Following the military and financial reforms other changes came, generally in administrative matters. Although these reforms were subjected too many modifications and changes throughout Maria Theresa's reign and after, the result was a government far more centralized than it had ever been before.

In 1784 he informed the Hungarian government that its official language, Latin, was really not effective for modern government and would be changed to German. To add to their horror, Joseph refused to submit to a coronation in Hungary lest he have to swear to uphold laws that he did not wish to, and then he had the sacred crown of the kingdom moved to Vienna. In March 1787 Joseph swept away the constitution of the Austrian Netherlands and announced that from then on it would be ruled according to absolutist principles. Resistance simmered in the Austrian Netherlands until 1789 when it boiled over into open revolt. By that time there also were rumors of rebellion in Hungary and in Galicia, and for a time it appeared as if revolution might erupt in many parts of the monarchy.
