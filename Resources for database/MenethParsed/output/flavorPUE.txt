Years have passed since that first encounter and our land has been attacked, misused and insulted. Our people have seen soldiers, missionaries and settlers come and go through their own houses. But now we have had enough.\nSome of our leaders have gained support from more than 40 of our villages and have waited, patiently, for the right moment to strike. Each morning they would untie a knot from a cord, and when the last one was to be untied, the fight should start.\nToday was that morning.

And they have found something: Colors red, green, white, yellow, brown, all of them used in marvelous murals that decorate the most important rooms. Most of them represent hunting scenes, feasts, dances, simple lines and spirals. But there is one that does not look quite like the others. A big spider sets eyes on the entrance.
