** desc = 0 "The battle between us and troops of the Inca Empire occurred between the Maule River and the Itata River. Their borders are though far from us and there is a chance that we will escape Inca rule. We have for the first time met people with a clear state organization and it has opened our eyes. The battles between us and the Inca have given us an awareness of the difference between them and us, what distinguishes us and the invaders. We have realized that it is time to unite and form something that will protect us from the Incas and other invaders.
