To support his policies, he also greatly enlarged the size of the royal navy.

In 1719 the Government borrowed 1.5 billion livres from the company. The company was more of a financial institution than a Company of Trade and Industry and the price of shares hit the roof. In 1720 the French hausse turned into a baisse and the fact that the shares of the Company were overvalued was evident even to the man on the street. Soon panic broke out and the Company was declared bankrupt. John Law was forced to flee from France.

When the overheated economy started to recycle with reality the shareholders of the trade company panicked driving both the Bank and the Trade Company into bankruptcy. As much of two years of collected tax money disappeared in the catastrophe and France thus was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1724.
