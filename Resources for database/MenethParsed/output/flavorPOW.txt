He has given us many presents brought from their distant home, stating that they need our help to survive in this foreign land, his hands almost trembling, stiffly grabbing a small piece of paper. When asked about it, his voice quivered while he offered us the opportunity to play allegiance to their ruler in exchange for protection under the crown, and some knowledge of their form of government.

We showed them how to farm the land and which path to follow when going into the wilderness.\nThen, they started to ask for more. They retired to their forts; they did not need us anymore, but they needed our land.
