They wrap [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s body in clothes, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was still alive, and place [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] on the platform, along with many of the personal belongings [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had treasured in life.\nThe funeral is held, everything is cold, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s rule is over, rain falls.

Our hunters tried to get the most out of the remaining meat, but marks of claws and fangs had teared apart almost all of it.\nThen, they found some more. Bodies of buffalos hunted down, laying on their backs, dead on the ground. One of our young men decided to go alone this morning and try to follow the dead trail. It did not take long for him to discover what was happening. His eyes encountered another pair of eyes, eager eyes, hungry eyes.\nA Great Plains wolf was standing over a buffalo corpse, his jaw still dripping with fresh blood. The young man moved very slowly, quietly, and came back to our village, leaving the animal alone in his feast.
