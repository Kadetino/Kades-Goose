These were the Dutch, English, French and Spanish fleeing from the narrow-minded Catholic governments of their former countries. The refugees were a mix of farmers and city-dwellers and they influenced the Lithuanians in a similar way as the earlier Protestants. However, the Lithuanian Magnates in opposition of the king viewed fellow Poland as the perfect societal form. When the king converted to the Lutheran form of Protestantism, many of them became reformed. Both to underline their difference with the king and because the Reformed ideals place God before king. The Reformed faith was also a perfect ideology for them to imprint upon the serfs. They were serfs because God wanted them to be and thus they became more manageable. In the 1630's a growing dissent between the Protestant state on one hand and the Reformed and Orthodox magnates on the other could be felt.

All in all his ideal was an effective and modern monarchy much inspired by the Swedish kings. Building up a Protestant Church of Lithuania and getting inspiration for governmental and societal reforms, the king turned to Sweden. The cooperation was of mutual benefits as Sweden soon got a Protestant friend in otherwise heretic Eastern Europe. Slowly the friendship brought a strong alliance about and King Ladislovas I eagerly encouraged Gustav II Adolphus to promote Protestantism in Germany. He himself would hold the Catholics and Orthodox of the East in check.

Brandenburg-Prussia was a Protestant state with high tolerance towards Reformed and she approached Jerzy I with an offer. Lithuania and Brandenburg should sign a Holy Protestant Alliance and wage war on Poland. Brandenburg would be freed from her Prussian vassalage by Poland and Lithuania would be whatever she wanted and could demand from Poland. A faction of young governmental official cherished it, but the king was a very careful man. He and his closest advisors hesitated. Their conclusion was very plain. First it was an impossibility to support Germans against Poland in a war of aggression. Secondly, the worst possible thing was total victory. If Lithuania took a mile of Polish land it would be a mile too much. Any conquests would include more Catholics and Orthodox and worse, more unruly magnates brought up in the Polish Anarchy of a country. So the king politely declined the honor, but instead he proposed a tract of trade and cultural exchange. However as most politically well-informed Lithuanians could have guessed, not much came out of it. The Society of Brandenburg-Prussia had far more in common with Poland than with Lithuania.

Maximilian was as sharp a politician as Mikolaj and profited on weakening Poland. Now Mikolaj's position was very bad in the 1570s he had to fight broad factions of Magnates in what could be described as a Civil War and defend his borders from Polish acts of revenge or even a re-conquest. He had to do what served independence best and that was to strike a deal with Maximilian. A Military Alliance was signed on 3rd February 1570 and Mikolaj's eldest son married Elizabeth of Steiermark. This alliance actually kept Poland from attacking even if local border incursions were regular. With the ascending of Rudolf to the Habsburg Monarchy the relations became wary and the alliance fell, but at that time the relations with Poland were at least acceptable.

The rights to hold office were expanded, but were now also made a duty and only the king had the right to appoint. The Szlachta was given a say in the making of Foreign Policy as a second house for non-Szlachta members was instituted in the Sejm which held legislative power of taxation.

They freely swapped lands with their Polish brothers and thus managed to strengthen the Cause in both Poland and Lithuania. During the Deluge the Magnates of the Ukraine and the Wild Fields fought all and everyone. Poland was in havoc and the Lithuanian king had to accept the fact that he only could control the Northern part of his lands. At these point King Aleksandras II mounted a huge campaign against the Tatars, Russians and Crimeans swapping up rebellious Magnates at the same time. He though stopped from interfering with the Polish government, 'that last sane mind on that side of the border' as he called King Wladyslaw IV of Poland. The subjugated Magnates had two options. They either had to accept a tough reform or get all their lands confiscated and pushed over the border to Poland. The choice was easy. They stayed, but the reform was harsh. Only the state could now own land. The user only owned the right to use it. But to keep that right the user had to pay a user's fee decided by the king. With this vehicle the king started to break the large estate holdings of the Magnates and again changing the structure of society. His son continued the reform policy after the King was murdered by a Ukrainian Magnate on 30th March 1654.
