** desc = 0 "The confederation of several Maya states crumbled and fell during the 15th century, fragmenting the Yucatán region into several petty states. The largest ones were the Itza, the Xiu, the Cocomes and the K'iche'. This former alliance was formed after the fall of Chichen Itzá and might not have been entirely voluntary. Mercenaries were hired to enforce the alliance and the nobles of the tribes were forced to live inside the walls of Mayapan to make sure their kingdoms remained loyal. The league began to disintegrate in 1175 but it was not until the middle of the 15th century when a war between the Uxmal and Cocom created segregation and uprisings which lead to its complete collapse.
