Through them he knows his dominion over Tibet will be secured; he must only choose how. The safest plan would be to secure a treaty with the Khans, seeking their assurance that they will do their utmost to defend Buddhism in Tibet, in particular the body of the reborn bodhisattva himself.\nA more radical approach has also occurred to the enlightened monk; if the Dalai Lama were to invite one of the Khans to rule as his puppet, he would never need fear resistance from Tibetâ€™s contentious noble families. Ruling from the shadows holds a certain appeal.\nHe turns to the Khans to announce his will, a placid smile hiding his veiled ambition.
