In order to approach the Chinese the order has learnt their customs, their language and in general tried to be a part of Chinese society.\nWith the arrival of Dominicans and Franciscans in China, however, disturbing reports have begun to reach us. It seems the Jesuits are tolerating a very high degree of non-Christian rituals among the supposedly converted Chinese. The other orders are abhorred by the Jesuit conduct and by their supposedly Christian converts and have urged us to make a clear statement that the Chinese Ancestor rites have no place among Christians and that anyone who wishes to join our Church must abandon such things.
