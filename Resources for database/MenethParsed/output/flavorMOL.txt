After nearly a decade of cold cooperation, Ilias was caught plotting to once again seize the throne for himself, but was discovered  by Stefan who had his eyes gouged out.\nIlias sought refuge in Poland, where he had once been imprisoned, and vowed revenge against Stefan. Though Ilias died shortly after, his son Roman has donned his father's mantle and has secured Polish support in his bid for the Moldavian throne.\nRoman has promised to swear fealty to Poland on behalf of the Principality of Moldavia, ending our independence but guaranteeing Polish protection. Poland is not the only interested party however. [Root.Monarch.GetName] currently shares the throne with his brother Petru who has close ties with the lords of Hungary. We therefore might escape Polish rule by seeking Hungarian support, though it would likely come at the same cost.
