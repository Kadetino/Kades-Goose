Our legend says that the Goddesses of the Moon and the Cloud visited Earth one day when they were attacked by a Yaguarete - a jaguar. The Goddesses were saved by an old man, who told them that he had stayed behind when his tribe moved on to protect his young daughter and wife. He invited them to his hut and the next day when the Goddesses left, they discussed what they would give the old man and his family as compensation. They decided on a new kind of plant which they sowed and grew while the family slept. When the family woke up the Goddess of the Moon told them who she was and that they were given this plant as a gift for their goodness. The plant was to be the symbol of friendship and she taught them how to toast the yerba and to drink the mate. This is how the 'Drink of Friendship' came to be.
