He becomes one of the most devoted counter reformists and enemy number one of the Protestant movement. Loyola having a soldier background makes its mark on the order, which is organized almost as an army. High priority was given both to educating missionaries but also counselors for European royal courts. This made the Jesuite order very powerful in the politic scene. 1773 the Jesuite order was dissolved by Pope Pius VI due to pressure from Christian countries in the age of enlightenment. 1814 the Jesuite order was reinstituted, however, just as a faint shadow of the powerful order it once had been.
