Initially he was accompanying George Wishart on his preaching tours, but Wishart was captured and handed over to Cardinal David Beaton in St Andrews. There he was tried and burned on the stakes in 1546 for spreading Protestant heresy. Three months later Cardinal Beaton was murdered in revenge by Protestants. When John Knox arrived in St Andrews about a year later he was persuaded by scholars at the university to preach in the town. In June 1547, French assistance to fight the Protestants arrived and the castle of St Andrews which capitulated on terms that were later not kept. Knox and others were carried off to slavery in the French galleys but due to English intervention Knox was released 19 months later. He could, however, not return to Scotland and continue his preaching but had to stay under the protection of the English and had a large influence on the forming of the English Puritanism. He stayed in England until the Catholic Mary Tudor ascended the throne, at which time he thought it wise to flee to the continent. There he formulated his view that God-fearing magistrates and nobility have both the right and the duty to resist, if necessary by force, a ruler who threatens the safety of true religion. In 1559 he again was able to return to Scotland and was astounded by the progress made by the Reformed cause and by the eager reception given to him by all classes in the community.

After venturing into a tunnel which went far out into the Firth of Forth, the king found himself at a shaft point where the coal was loaded onto the ships. Water surrounded the top of the shaft and king James, alarmed with this, accused Sir George of an assassination attempt and of treason. George Bruce then pointed out the rowing boat and explained that they could either use the boat or return by the tunnel from whence they came. The king relaxed and took the option of the boat journey.
