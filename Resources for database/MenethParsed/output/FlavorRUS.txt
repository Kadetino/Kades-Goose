Heterodox sects such as the Dukhobors formed and attached themselves to the Raskolniki to avoid persecution. By 1658, Nikon had aroused sufficiently powerful opposition to bring about his banishment, and in 1666 he was deposed and degraded.

Having acquired great fame and wealth, Razin launched a new campaign in 1670 against the czar's fortress cities on the Volga. With a force of about 7,000 Cossacks, he seized Tsaritsyn and Astrakhan. In both towns Razin and his men engaged in drunken orgies and perpetrated savage atrocities against the nobles and military officers - he also replaced the local governments with Cossack institutions of self-rule. Razin continued his advance up the Volga, and along the way he incited the serfs and urban lower classes to join his rebellion. He captured Saratov and proceeded to Simbirsk, while his insurrection spread throughout the Volga region and even into some of the central Russian provinces. Alarmed at Razin's success, Czar Alexis sent an army to relieve Simbirsk. The force inflicted a decisive defeat on Razin's undisciplined and badly equipped troops. Razin fled to the Don, but on April 24, 1671, he was captured by loyalist Cossacks and turned over to the tsarist authorities. Brought to Moscow and tortured, Razin was executed by quartering in Red Square.

However, with British and Dutch naval assistance, Charles XII landed on Zealand and promptly defeated the Danes, then moved to Estland where his badly outnumbered Swedes (1 to 5) won a crushing victory over the Russians. Instead of finishing the Russians, Charles moved against August II of Poland-Saxony and drove him out of Poland in 1704 (having the pro-Swedish Stanislaw Leszczynski elected King), then subjugating Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St. Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via the Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded king escaped to the Ottomans. The Russians were encircled by the Ottomans on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov. While Charles was still exiled in Turkey, Russian, Danish, Hanoverian and even Prussian troops captured most of the Swedish provinces around the Baltic. Having emerged from Turkish internment, Charles got killed in 1718 in front of the Norwegian fortress of Frederickshald. The peace treaties that followed Sweden lost most of her Baltic empire.

When confronted with the realities of power, Catherine saw very quickly that emancipation of the serfs would never be tolerated by the owners, whom she depended upon for support, and who would throw the country into disorder once they lost their own means of support. The fortune of a noble was evaluated not in lands but in the 'souls' he owned. Catherine instead turned her attention to organizing and strengthening a system that she herself had condemned as inhuman. She imposed serfdom on the Ukrainians who had until then been free. By distributing the crown lands to her favorites and ministers, she worsened the lot of the peasants, who had enjoyed certain autonomy. At the end of her reign, there was scarcely a free peasant left in Russia.

Nevertheless, despite the humanitarian ideas inculcated in him by his tutor La Harpe and despite his own wish to make his people happy, Alexander lacked the energy necessary to carry out the most urgent reform, the full abolition of serfdom.
