During the long and painful recovery, Ignacio read a translated version of Ludolph of Saxony's 'De Vita Christi' - a commentary on the life of Jesus that had a great influence on Loyola. He abandoned his military life and decided to devote himself entirely to serving God. In 1534 he and six companions formed the Society of Jesus, commonly known as the Jesuits, devoted to opposing heresy and actively promoting the counter-reformation.

Spain had for many years undercut its tax base and what was worse, had no control of the price-fluctuations from the inflow of American silver and gold. It was impossible for the Spanish minister of finance to forecast any repayments as all costs fluctuated volatile. The spending was based on the planned budget, but the inflow was irregular at best which made Spain spend more than it actually had, thus the Great Bankruptcies of 1557 and 1596.

This logic was lost on the Catalans. The peasants, urged on by their clergy, refused to support the troops. Soon there were clashes with the population, then riots and open rebellion. On June 7 the mob murdered the viceroy in Barcelona. In the autumn of 1640 Olivares scraped together the last available troops and sent them against the Catalan rebels. The rebel leader, Pau Claris, countered by transferring Catalan allegiance to the king of France, 'as in the time of Charlemagne' (Jan. 1641). French troops now entered Catalonia. Only when the renewed French civil wars (the Fronde) induced the French to withdraw their army was the Castilians able to re-conquer Catalonia (1652).

A long 24 years struggle, along with Spanish defeat in the Thirty Years War (1648), peace with France (1659) would lead to a renewed independence for Portugal, under the new Braganza dynasty, which would turn to Stuart England as an ally and protector (marriage of Catherine of Braganza with Charles II and transfer of Bombay to England as a dowry).

Under Conde de Floridablanca, as he was simply known in Spain, the Spanish enlightened despotism reached its peak, and his internal reforms, notably in finance, helped centralize the state. This, however, brought him into conflict with especially the Aragonese faction at court who accused him of embezzlement. After serving a three-year sentence he withdrew from public life.
