In his absence his wife, Goharshad, had taken over the daily rule of the empire but this sign of weakness has set wheels in motion among the princes that rule the Timurid provinces.\n\nIn western Iran the young prince Muhammad Baysonqor, an ambitious grandson, has started to accept taxes and tokens of loyalty from a much larger region than his assigned governorate. Having finally recovered and learned of this insolence Shah Rukh has now declared Muhammad Baysonqor a rebel and is moving to strike at him at first opportunity.\nIf a civil war among all sons and grandsons, like that at the end of Timurs life, is to be avoided Shah Rukh knows he must strike down any sign of rebellion harshly and quickly.
