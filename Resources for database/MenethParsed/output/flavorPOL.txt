The Freedom of religion and the ideological principle of religious tolerance was the foundation of Polish society. Sigismund was strong-willed and stubborn, so he tried nevertheless.

However, with British and Dutch naval assistance, Charles XII landed on Zealand and promptly defeated the Danes, then moved to Estland where his badly outnumbered Swedes (1 to 5) won a crushing victory over the Russians. Instead of finishing the Russians, Charles moved against August II of Poland-Saxony and drove him out of Poland in 1704 (having the pro-Swedish Stanislaw Leszczynski elected King), then subjugating Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via the Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded king escaped to the Ottomans. The Russians were encircled by the Ottomans on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov. While Charles was still exiled in Turkey, Russian, Danish, Hanoverian and even Prussian troops captured most of the Swedish land around the Baltic. Having emerged from Turkish internment, Charles got killed in 1718 in front of the Norwegian fortress of Frederickshald. In the peace treaties that followed Sweden lost most of her Baltic empire.

In that very moment Jan Sobieski had such status and personal power coming from his very person that he could have ended the stagnation of Poland or at least he could have tried. Merely the different political climate during the earlier days of his reign is a proof of him being a very special monarch. He was never that limited by vetoes or articles as earlier monarchs, but in the end he chose a different path. He chose to continue the campaign against the Ottoman, a campaign he could not win decisively, while at the same time having to cope with growing dissent from magnates disliking this policy. When he stopped campaigning he suffered heavily from gallstones and he never managed to make the magnates forget that he was just one of them. He never managed to translate his popularity in the Szlachta, as whole, into concerted political action. If he instead had gone home after relieving Vienna and picked a fight with the magnates something completely different might have happened. Well who knows...?

He was a German and because of his inability to win a war he himself had started he is considered a rather bad Polish king. However, when Friedrich Augustus became king he had a plan. He was not a stupid man, and he intended to turn the Commonwealth into a centralized monarchical state. He was a child of the same ideas as his contemporaries in Berlin, Hannover and München, and he needed a war to accomplish it. Like Sobieski, he saw war as the surest way to gain prestige and a free hand to carry out his plan. Now Friedrich Augustus made certain mistakes. He and his allies underestimated the ease with which they would smash the eighteen year old monarch of Sweden and secondly Friedrich August was no Sobieskian General. The failure of the war and his lost prestige from being a lousy soldier and having been forced to a humiliating abdication ruined every chance to reform anything. Instead he ruined any chance for monarchism in Poland as his return was with the arrivals of Russian bayonets. However... had he won the war and Poland had been a winner while Russia had become rather mauled then his position would have been different. Instead of buying art for his castles in Dresden he might very well have used that prestige and military power with boldness and brute force to accomplish the impossible...

In 1766 Chancellor Zamoyski laid before the Sejm his project for constitutional reform which included the abolition of the Liberum Veto. This elicited an immediate response from St Petersburg and Berlin, both of which threatened with war if it were not withdrawn, and if the Confederated Sejm was not immediately dissolved. The King and his supporters had little to do but comply, trapped in Warszawa as they were. But people started to wake up from their 'Saxon slumber' and the Confederates refused to comply. At the same time some magnates wanted to get rid of the upstart Stanislaus and united with Russian forces under the young general Suvorov, they fought and destroyed the Confederated troops.

Poland will raise a substantial army and support Russia in her war with the Ottomans, and make flanking maneuvers against potential attacks from Prussia or Sweden. The move was smart as it would mean that the king would have an army that could defend the country from enemies abroad and within, but Catherine did not fall for. She preferred having Poland as a piece of no-man's-land in between her and Prussia and Austria. As this failed, the King stood without a plan and a decent foreign policy. The next year members of the so-called 'Patriotic Party' took matters in their own hands in the Great Sejm. It voted an increase of the army and vested control over it in a Sejm Commission. It placed the conduct of foreign policy in the hands of another Sejm Commission. It also abolished the Permanent Council that had governed the country since 1772 and imposed tax on incomes from lands, 10 percent for the Szlachta and 20 percent for the Church. In 1791 the king arrived from his isolation since the failure with Catherine and together with Stanislaw Potocki and Hugo Kollataj he drafted the New Constitution of May 3. This became the first written Constitution in Europe and a satisfactory compromise between the republicanism of Potocki, the radicalism of Kollataj and the monarchism of the king. Again Catherine the Great reacted, and as circumstances went against Poland, peace was signed between the Ottomans and Russia, and 89000 seasoned veterans now stood against the 37000 staunchly heroic, but no less, newly recruited Poles. No one helped Poland and the outcome was devastating. Thus the Effort to end stagnation brought the Second Partition of Poland.

He created a Naval Commission with Gerard Denhoff to fulfill the task of building a new fleet. The Sejm did not support the new fleet due to high costs and reluctance to strengthen the king's power which crippled king Wladyslaw's plans. The king chose wealthy members to the Commission, including the merchant and owner of a merchant fleet from Danzig, Georg Hewel, to finance the new war fleet. Ten ships, of which a few carried small caliber cannons, were given to Wladyslaw IV from Hewel and the new 'Polish Fleet' consisted of 10 ex-merchant ships, six smaller ships and one small galley, under the command of rear admiral Aleksander Seton. Due to unfortunate international alliances, a majority of defensive wars and a new armistice with Sweden removed the last of the king's argument for a Polish fleet and Wladyslaw decided to use his ships to organize the first Polish merchant company. Hewel's death stopped those plans and finally the ships were sold.

At first, only a small part of the szlachta, or 'noble class', would assert its privilege to choose the next king (or, in 1384 and 1523 Queen, since they backed Jadwiga's and Anna's claims). But eventually the right to elect the ruler of Poland was extended to Polish nobles. Keep in mind that in Poland, nobility was inherited by all children of an entitled person, so at its peak, half a million Poles could claim a voice in the election - by far the widest possible franchise in Renaissance Europe and probably the largest 'democratic' system until American and French Republics. True royal elections began in 1573 at the election of Henry of Valois, since foreign princes were always claiming the Polish throne anyway, why not have the nobles choose among them.\n\nDuring the Commonwealth period, the Kings of Poland and Grand Princes of Lithuania were elected by noble gatherings at a field in Wola, just outside Warsaw. Tens of thousands of nobles could be expected to attend, and the richest magnates would mingle with the poorest count in exchanges of favors and votes. This first election took four days to conclude (future ones would be smaller and over in a day or two) and these events would be full of parties, fairs and armed men. While the election was going on, royal power would be vested in an interrex, a temporary regent - usually the Primate of Warsaw, who would oversee the voting.
