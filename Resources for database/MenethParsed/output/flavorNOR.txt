Instead of building in timber and awaiting the next catastrophe it has been suggested that we rebuild closer to Akershus fortress, using sounder techniques of construction and city planning as befits a capital of our age.\nRebuilding closer to Akershus will also allow us to properly fortify the city, which can be of great benefit in these times. In practice previous rulers have found it hard to prevent the citizens of Oslo to rebuild in whichever materials and mode they wish however, so a proper renovation is likely to be very costly.
