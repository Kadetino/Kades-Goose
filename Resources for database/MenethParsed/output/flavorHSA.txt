The member communities have chosen Ratssendeboten or envoys to represent their local consensus on the issue at the Hansetag. This Hansetag brought up some issues with the trade, the economy and the military. As the envoys haven't managed to reach a conclusion as to which of these matters we should address, and although the consensus-building at the Hansetag is supposed to follow the Low Saxon tradition of Einung, it is our duty to decide which matter to address.
