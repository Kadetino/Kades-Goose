George Washington managed to quell the rebellion but the resistance against the tax is still strong.

At a late stage the majority in New York changed and the new electoral votes changed the balance into the favor of Jefferson.

Among the elites of the country many still supported the Federalists and Pinckney, but the masses were discouraged by the behavior of the Junta. The Biggest Issue was the Louisiana Purchase as Federalists feared that more immigrants (Jefferson-supporters that is) would break the balance of power at the expense of the Federalists.

******** desc = 0 "During the years up to the War of 1812 the British had never respected the independence of the United States de facto. Great Britain disrespected US neutral rights at sea and impressed American seamen and confiscated the goods of her ships at sea. She also encouraged and supported Indian Unrest in the West. This together with the fact that some American gentlemen like Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun lobbied aggressively for war in an effort to exploit the opportunity to seize Canada made it hard for the President in International affairs. The Nation was though badly divided and when the President asked the Congress for a declaration of war (June1) the South and the West voted for and New England against. The war was not a great success for the United States military and the White House was bombarded by the Royal Navy. Only the Battle of New Orleans in 1815 was considered a victory. The war ended in a status quo peace, but it could very well have ended differently. Who will you choose Mr. President?

Because the United States suffered early defeats in the West, DeWitt Clinton's supporters blasted the president for incompetence in directing the war effort, a war that Federalists denounced as groundless. Madison's campaigners defended the war as necessary to establish American neutral rights. Madison was not that popular, but two things turned against Clinton. First, Clinton tried to appeal to hawks and doves alike making his position non-credible. Second, Madison was a president at war and people rallied to his defense. Electoral Votes: Madison 128, Clinton 89. How will the Spirit of America choose this time?

******** desc = 0 "Campaign and the Issues, 1816: There were no big issues. James Monroe was supported by two popular former presidents, Jefferson and Madison, and Monroe was a skilled tactician doing very little campaigning. The election was a sure thing all from the beginning as there were in fact only one efficient party, the Republicans. The Federalists existed, but was trashed from opposing the War of 1812 and had its voters in the New England area. Its organization and form was old and obsolete and it did not even officially nominate a candidate. It though supported Rufus King who put up only token opposition against the republican juggernaut. The Republicans was on the other hand an all-American movement with strong bases in New York, Virginia and in the South from which it campaign with skill and effect. Four republican presidential terms in a row had strengthened the party proportionally to the decline of the Federalists. James Monroe won a walk-over even if it was not as superior as his victory in 1820 where he grabbed all electors but one. Electoral Votes: Monroe 183, King 34.
