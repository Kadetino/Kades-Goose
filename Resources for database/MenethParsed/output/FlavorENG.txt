Future wars saw far less factionalism, at least on the scale found in medieval conflicts. The Hundred Years War was actually dozens of little wars and hundreds of battles and sieges that went on for over a century, between 1337 and 1453, until both sides were exhausted. While neither side won in any real sense, the end result was that while there were two kingdoms at the beginning of the war, there were two nations at the end of it.

It required that justices devote part of every quarter session to acknowledgment of the areas in which they themselves are particularly weak. The same act provided the general populace with the right to complain about the actions of justices directly to the monarch or his council. The appointment of the justices by the Lord Chancellor at irregular annual intervals allowed for the possible removal of uncooperative gentlemen at the next annual re-issue of the commissions.

As people congregated in cities, they became a source of cheap labor for the factories and mines that developed. The concentration of population into cities, however, also created a class of poor, many of whom were willing to became 'indentured servants' and migrate to the North American colonies in search of a better life.

** desc = 0 "Queen Elizabeth I sought to bring about a religious settlement with the objective of establishing in England a Protestant Anglican Church with herself as the Supreme Governor. Things began to fray around the edges when Mary Queen of Scots fled to England. The problem for Elizabeth I was that Mary was a Catholic claimant to the English throne. Elizabeth I had Mary locked away in various castles, but she still became the center of numerous conspiracies to overthrow the upstarts who had displaced the ancient aristocracy. Their basic idea was to marry Mary to Norfolk, England's only Duke. This combination represented a serious threat to Elizabeth I but Norfolk seemed undecided and continued to delay until Elizabeth I invited him to London whereupon she locked him in the Tower. Elizabeth I suspected that the Earls of Northumberland, Westmorland and Cumberland were involved in the conspiracy and invited them to London as well. The Earls guessed their accommodation would be the Tower and opted instead for a rebellion which began at about midnight on the 9 November 1569. The Catholic faith had survived in the North and there was real resentment against the extension of Tudor domination and Elizabeth I's new men. The Earl of Northumberland mustered his troops in Richmond on the 16 November. Sir George was appointed provost marshal and martial law was declared. Elizabeth I ordered that 700 of the riffraff be executed, 200 of these were to be from or around Richmond. How many were actually executed is not known but seemingly it was a smaller number, perhaps around 57, 12 of whom were from Richmond. The decade after the Rebellion was a difficult period for Catholics who faced constant persecution. Religious meetings were held in secret, away from the eyes of unfriendly informants. It seems, however, that the few gentry who were accused in court of holding Catholic beliefs were the 'mere tip of a great pyramid' which represented a hidden underground movement.

At last he formed an alliance with the other Irish chiefs and sought aid against Protestant England from Catholic Spain. He achieved something like unity among his allies and, after 1595, defeated some of Queen Elizabeth's best commanders in Ireland. O'Neill was defeated while attempting to join a Spanish force that arrived at Kinsale in 1601. His Irish allies dispersed, and O'Neill retreated to Ulster. In 1603 he made peace with the English, surrendering his tribal authority. King James I later pardoned him.

Elizabeth I had a mix of determination, majestic presence and kindness towards the members of Parliament that her successors Jacob I and his son Charles I did not. The Parliament wanted to have more say in matters of the Church, justice and taxes to which the King naturally was opposed. When Jacob I tried to propose marriage of his son to a Spanish, and later a French princess (both Catholic) they had enough. The Parliament of 1628 voiced the Petition of Right which forbade arrests and taxation ordered by the King. In 1629 the Parliament voted for resolutions to condemn Religious and Tax politics and the King opposed the Parliament and tried to dissolve it. Eleven years of Dictatorship ensued. In 1642 the Civil War divided the country into Cavaliers (Royalists) versus Roundheads (the Parliament's wigless).

But all this was done without even notifying the King they were claiming to support. The Old Pretender, King James III, was not even aware of the situation as of yet. Word was sent to the King, and the size of the force continued to grow. The Earl, with his growing army, moved to Perth and established his base there after taking the city. Meanwhile another Jacobite army was forming to the south, The Old Pretender hearing the news began to make preparations for his trip to Scotland and his crowning. By early November, the northern Jacobite army numbered some 12,000, mostly Clansmen from the Highlands. The Earl then decided to march south where he soon met the army of the Duke of Argyll, the only remaining government troops in Scotland. The Jacobite forces were mismanaged and split. The southern army marched south to raise Lancashire instead of turning on the Duke of Argyll's flank, while a much smaller force under the Duke defeated the larger northern army of the Jacobites at Sheriffmuir on November 13th. The southern army was also met and defeated at Preston by other government forces in England. The Jacobites were forced to retreat to Perth, while still waiting for their leader to arrive. The Old Pretender finally arrived in Scotland on the 22nd of December after leaving fittingly enough from Dunkirk. But the matter was already settled, as the Duke of Argyll was already receiving reinforcements of experienced troops and was preparing an overwhelming force to march north. The King, James III, was again forced to retreat after spending a dismal six weeks in Scotland.

At the head of a small army, he then invaded England as far as Derby, but had to retreat when promised French support did not materialize (the intended landing of French troops had failed). Caught up by the British army under Cumberland (recalled from the Low Countries), he was soundly defeated at Culloden on 16th April, 1746. This was the best shot the Stuarts ever got to reclaim the throne, but the rash young prince did not listen to the sober advice of his Generals, thus forever burying the Stuart cause.

Its first trading posts in the Moluccas (Amboina) and Indonesia were soon overwhelmed and closed by the Dutch and activity concentrated to India (Madras, Bombay, Calcutta). It is there that she would know its greatest success, from a small trading ventures of harbor factories to the large Indian Empire build by Warren Hastings and Robert Clive (from 1757 onwards) that would control most of the Indian subcontinent. The company would outlast all its competitors and would only be taken over by the British government in 1867, in the wake of the great Sepoy revolt of 1857.

In December 1783, King George III took the opportunity to dismiss the coalition and asked the 24-year-old Pitt to form a government. When Parliament reassembled in January 1784, the government was at once defeated by 39 votes on a virtual motion of censure, but Pitt refused to resign, and gradually the coalition's majority in Parliament began to crumble. By March 8 the majority against him was one vote, and on March 25 Parliament was dissolved. In 1788 he signed the Triple Alliance between Britain, Prussia, and Holland, thereby ensuring that in a future war his country would not be bereft of allies as it had been during the American Revolution. In 1790 he demonstrated Britain's renewed power and prestige by negotiating a peace between Austria and Turkey. In 1784 he passed his own India Act, creating a board of control regulating Indian affairs and the East India Company. Finally, in 1791 the Canada Constitutional Act was passed. London became responsible for the government of both Lower and Upper Canada, but both provinces were given representative assemblies.
