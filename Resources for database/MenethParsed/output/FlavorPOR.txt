** desc = 0 "Construction of the Jerónimos Monastery began in 1501 and was originally funded by Manuel I using the income from the 'Vintena da Pimenta' tax on goods from Africa and the Far East. Work stopped in 1580 when Portugal after the death of Sebastian I of Portugal and a succession crisis entered into a union with Spain. When Portugal became independent again in 1640, the monastery saw further construction with the addition of a gold tiled ceiling in 1669 and large frescos completed at the end of the 18th century. The monastery also became the burial place for the royal family.

** desc = 0 "Vasco da Gama became the first Portuguese to reach India when he landed near Calicut on May 20, 1498. Despite protests from Arab merchants, da Gama managed to secure trading rights with the Zamorin ruler, but later failed to produce the gold required to pay for custom fees. On the whole, da Gama's expedition turned out to be very profitable as the value of the cargo brought back was sixty times the cost of the expedition.
