The examining Court was confined to a return of fact. It was called on to state whether the examinee was or was not guilty of heresy. Punishment was reserved to the secular authority. This arrangement did not satisfy the Court of Rome, an Inquisitor was appointed by the Pope, but he required the Doge's exequatur before he could act, and a board was created of three Venetian nobles, to sit as assessors to the Holy Office. Their duty was to guard the rights of Venetian citizens against ecclesiastical encroachment, including the non-interference in religious matters within the colonies, without their presence and their sanction no act of the Holy Office was valid in Venice. The Inquisition in Venice was certainly no sanguinary Office, thanks no doubt in a large degree to the independent attitude of the State, which insisted upon the presence of lay assessors at every trial.

As we cannot expect such noble families to labor for their living the Venetian state traditionally affords them small pensions to live on.\nWith the chaotic political situation in the east, the fall of the Byzantine Empire and the loss of Venetian influence in parts of the Eastern Mediterranean, this group of poor nobles have been growing quickly. The great number of impoverished nobles are known to spend their pensions on gambling in or near the Campo San Barnaba and some will even sell their votes to anyone willing to pay. Sometimes referred to as Barnabotti, after the Campo in which they reside, this group is still not a great problem. If this development continues, however, it might well undermine the Great Council and unduly increase the power of those with the money to pay for votes.

Doing that is, however, not popular among those who would rather rely on their bought votes or who would fear more competition.\nRecently a relatively harmless proposition was put forward however, a school could be created for the children of the nobles to ensure that they are given a proper education that their parents might not be able to afford. This would also allow at least a few select of them to rise above their original status and do useful things for the state again.
