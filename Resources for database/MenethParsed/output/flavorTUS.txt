Despite being challenged at every turn, many of his goals were achieved, such as guaranteeing legal rights for citizens, improving the treatment of the mentally ill, and one of the earliest smallpox inoculation programs. \nPeter Leopold also attempted to introduce a constitution in Tuscany. This would see greater rights given to its citizens, and ensure a balance between legislative and executive powers.\n\nThe constitution met fierce resistance, even from those who would benefit from it, and was never put into effect. The cause had to be abandoned in 1790, when Leopold moved to Vienna to accept the mantle of Holy Roman Emperor.
