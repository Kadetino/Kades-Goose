** desc = 0 "The powerful Tlaxcaltec warrior called Tlalhuicole was captured by the Aztecs! Only now has news of his fate reached us. The ruler of the Aztecs was struck by Tlalhuicole's bravery and character and ordered his release. Tlalhuicole refused the monarch's generosity, demanding that he would undergo the same fate as the other prisoners. The Aztec monarch offered him the command of an army about to be sent to drive back the Tarascan, which Tlalhuicole accepted in the hopes of a glorious death in the ensuing battle. He defeated the Tarascan army despite their desperate resistance and returned to the Aztecs with spoils of war and many captives. Although the Aztec monarch tried to persuade Tlalhuicole he would not accept the place as commander-in-chief or return to Tlaxcala, as the first would be treason and the second a stain on his glory. Tlalhuicole got his wish, to be tied to the stone of the gladiators and sacrificed to the gods through battle. Eight warriors attacked Tlalhuicole, one after another, but they were all defeated. The ninth warrior managed to stun him and Tlalhuicole was ritually executed.
