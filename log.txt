Thoughts of disapproval against the Roman Catholic Church are spreading across Europe
as a result of the increasing corruption of monks and clerics. Voices are raised questioning
the current principles and greed of the Church. A monk in Aachen has for some time
expressed deep concerns and is now openly declaring his discontent with the Church,
